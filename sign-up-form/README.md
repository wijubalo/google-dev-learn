## What will you learn?

This codelab shows you how to use form elements and attributes to make the most of
built-in browser features to build a simple sign-up form that's secure, accessible
and easy to use.

The codelab does not explain how to implement sign-up via a third-party
identity provider (federated login) or show how to build backend
services to authenticate users, store credentials, and manage accounts.
